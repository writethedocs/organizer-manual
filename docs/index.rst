Welcome to the Write the Docs Organizer Manual!
===============================================

This guide aims to help anyone who wants to start a local Write the Docs meetup or a regional conference. Our community is growing quickly and we want to provide resources, guidelines, and tips on how to build and maintain events no matter where you are in the world.

All the content in this guide and in the resources repositories is open source, and we welcome contributions and suggestions! Feel free to communicate and share ideas with your fellow documentarians by creating issues in the GitHub repository, or better yet - by creating or improving content and submitting a pull request!

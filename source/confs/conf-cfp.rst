Speakers and Call for Proposals
===============================

This section describes how to:

* Manage the CFP
* Select talks
* Wrangle speakers before/during/after the conference

CFP Schedule
------------

The CFP should be scheduled to end around **3 months** prior to the conference.
This allows for time to book travel for speakers,
but also keeps the topics fresh and ensures the speakers are still passionate about them.

After the CFP ends,
reviews should be given 1 week to review all the talk proposals.
After this, we will have rate them following the below process,
and have the final group meeting where we talk through the final schedule

Selecting Talks
---------------

You should have:

* Access to the `cfp` Slack channel.
* Access to the CFP Google Doc

How it works:

* We allocate 2 points for every talk at the conference (eg. 30 points for 15 talks).
* You use those points to vote for which talks you want to see.
* We add up all the points and sort them by highest. This is the initial talk selection.
* We then argue for & against talks that we *really* want to change positions. This can either be because you know the speaker/topic will be good, two talks cover similar topics and we can only have one, or other reasons.
* We agree on a final set of 15 talks, along with 1 or 2 alternates.
  * If there are a ton of great talks that we want to see, we can reduce some to 15 minutes and fit 2 in a 30 minute slot.

Speaker Communication
---------------------

Like everyone,
most speakers don't really read their email.
This means you need to tell them everything important at least twice,
and probably again in person.

Speaker Rejection Template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This template varies by the rejection.
We reject folks in a couple different rounds,
which I'll document here.

Building a Schedule
-------------------

There are an infinite number of ways to arrange a schedule.
We've found it best to just randomly assign speakers to the schedule,
taking into account their availability (some folks can only speak on certain days).
After that,
you can shuffle speakers who you know are good to the following slots:

* Talk after lunch (should be high energy)
* Last talk of the day (should be memorable)

After this,
you send each speaker their time slot,
and confirm it works for them.
Give them a couple days to make changes,
then we can publish the schedule.

Biases

* New people
* Community members
